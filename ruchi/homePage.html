    <h1>NEPAL</h1>
    <p>
      In Nepal, a decade of peace has now followed a decade of war. The task of
      including different sections of society was central to the peace process,
      and this Accord tracks how this inclusion has progressed through the
      country’s post-war transition. Two steps forward, one step back: the Nepal
      peace process The enduring dominance of established elites and the
      historic discrimination of marginalised communities acted as key drivers
      to sustain Nepal’s civil war from 1996 to 2006. In response, how to
      support greater inclusion has been central to efforts to build peace. Yet
      it has proved challenging to push forward the inclusion agenda in Nepal’s
      complex post-war social and political landscape. Inclusive change has been
      variously advocated, incited, resisted and negotiated amongst social and
      political groups – elite and non-elite - for decades and in multiple forms
      Deepak Thapa and Alexander Ramsbotham, Accord 26 issue editors In
      reviewing Nepal’s peace process, this 26th edition in our Accord series
      takes a special focus on the function of power on inclusion, and the role
      of the peace process as a means to facilitate transition from negative to
      positive peace, or from horizontal (elite) to vertical (societal)
      inclusion. Since Nepal’s 2006 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA),
      constitutional federalism has been a central focus of efforts to
      reconfigure power and representation. But with constituencies from across
      Nepal’s political spectrum showing little willingness to compromise,
      attempts to embed inclusion in formal political structures have faced
      tough challenges. Many Nepalis have seen the federal project as zero-sum.
      Janajati and Madhesi activists felt that anything less achieving their
      full aspirations would represent total failure. On the other side, the
      conservative Khas Arya political elite and intellectuals believed that
      federalism would undermine national unity and interests Krishna Khanal,
      Accord 26 author and Professor of Political Science at Tribhuvan
      University (1979-2010) Episodic violence has gripped parts of the country
      since the CPA, often to protest unfulfilled promises of inclusion by
      political actors. Many perceive the 2015 Constitution as having failed to
      fulfil the aspirations of many marginalised groups for greater
      participation and rights. And victims of violence committed by prominent
      political actors are yet to see accountability or justice. Although there
      have been significant instances of social and political progress in Nepal
      over the past decade, social justice remains a long way off for many
      Nepalis outside the prevailing elite.
